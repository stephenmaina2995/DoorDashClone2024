# DoorDashClone2024

Design & Develop an intro website for Food Delivery by Drones (Note: an intro / promotion website, Not a fully working one). Preferably with React Next.js. (And FastAPI if you're going to use backend dev.)

Example websites: DoorDash Wing / Wing Delivery. Flytrex. FlyZipline. Etc.

There're bunch of example websites online that you could find.

You want to build a website that's similar to the above websites, but with slightly different designs. (Theme colors: blue, white, and others that you think which goes well with the website.) For example, you may want to add videos to the website (it could be a random drone video / a video of text description, just to showcase your skills) for a better design.

If selected, you could earn a $200 prize with an additional contact / full-time Web Dev role to our team.

Note: The quality (design and development) of the website is the top factor of consideration. However, the time you took to complete the Contest is also a factor of consideration. So the sooner you submit your entry once you complete it, the better it is.

## What to submit:
A PDF file that contains:
A. Pictures of your web design.
B. A github URL of your web dev repo, with docs about where and how to run.
C. A YouTube URL (could be unlisted / public) shows that your web runs and the features of your web.
D. (Optional) a cloud web (for example, Replit, AWS, etc.) URL of your entry.
E. (Optional) Explanation of your design and dev considerations, with a few sentences / paragraphs.
F. (Optional) Your contact info (email and LinkedIn profile, if you have one), if you'd want to be considered for a contract / full-time Web Dev role to our team later.
